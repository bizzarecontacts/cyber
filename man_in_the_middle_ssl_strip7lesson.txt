MAN IN THE MIDDLE

This a  is position where an attacker trasnfers data through him. MITM can work either on wlan or lan, However it is only possible if we are part of the network

   States of Attack : 
	Local to Local
	Local to Remote
	
   The manipulations are as follows : 

	-Data Theft
	-Data change
	-Denial of Service

   First Method ######

        ARP POISIONING - ( Layer 2 ) 
		*ARP has 2 problems ; 
			1. It has "Generious ARP" - No time period checks
			2. It doesn't check for integrity  
			
   Scenario : 

C and the Switch  are connected, C requests for google.com, Switch returns :  google.com doesn't exit, so it asks the router. Does C know the router's ip? Yes
	Router sends google.com to the Switch, The switch knows the MAC of C so C can now access google.com
	ARP Poisoning means that we constantly tell the switch "I AM C". 
	* Make sure Port fowarding is enabled. (  By default it is disabled ).
        # Inject : echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	
	Usage : arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 10.0.4.31 10.0.0.138 -r 
				     

We can also  do MAC FLAG since switches have a CAM table which stores information of MAC addresses through pyhsical ports.
Therefore we can brute-force this table with all MACS until either the switch duplicates or crashes. When a switch crashes, It transforms to a HUB.

   Second Method ######
      DNS POISIONING
        [DNS Table : 
            A > NR > IPv4
            AAAA> NR > Ipv6
            PTR > NR >- Ipv4/6 > Name
            MX > Mail > IP]

This specific attack requires a file called "hosts", This file exists both in Linux/Windows. 

    Usage : dnsspoof -i wlan0 --f [hosts] 
     Let's create a hosts file : Nano fake.hosts 

        10.0.0.32 www - Every bloody website our target enters will be forwarded to us ( 10.0.0.32 ).
        
Extra tools we can use in addition : 

1. urlsnarf - displays the web addresses including login forms the target visits ( not effective as most websites are https )
2. filesnarf - grab files
3. webspy - displays the website he visits
4. dsniff - data sniffer, sniff everything
5. Driftnet - displays images 
       
       
        SSL STRIP!
            Requirements : 
                  ip fowarding 
                  apr spoofing  
                  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10000
                  sslstrip -l 1000
                 
SSL STRIP defense a.k.a HSTS prevents this method.
