Password Cracking 

Some introduction :)



There is a difference between passwords and hashes. The more complicated the password, The harder it is to crack it. 
Hash is an equisized identifer calculated by applying special mathematical function(s) on arbitrarily sized values.
Since these functions are one-way, they protect any transmitted/stored data from being tampered with.


There are 4 ways to crack a password ;

	a, Guessing  - Social information/Personal that may hint a password ( Cat's name etc...)
	
	b, Phishing  - Pretending something that it isn't to steal a password 
	
	c, Dictionary Attack - A file consisted with the most common passwords used today.
	
	d, Cracking - Full brute force - Try everything until you get a hit.
	
	
	
HASH TYPES

md 5 - 128 bit. Considered vulnerable since 2013.
sha1 - 160 bit. Considered vulnerable since 2017
sha256 - used mainly in SSH and SSL
NTLM - reencoded text hashed with MD4
NetNTLM - an improved version of NTLM, which uses salts and time stamps to prevent PTH.
Blowfish - Well, its a real cipher and not a hash so much. This is for linux systems !!
