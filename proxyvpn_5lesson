VPN 
##################################

Virtual private network  extends a private network across a public networkץ
It enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network ( Tunnel )
In most cases tunnel enables the passage of most bandwidth. 
 
Difference between them ?  One is un-encrypted plain text, and the second is encrypted.

VPN works and encrypts ALL 7 layers ( OSI MODEL ).
