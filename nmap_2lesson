Network Scanning


Knowing the services running will aid us in understanding in which attack vector to use.
Knowing the service will help us narrow down a specific exploit or attack. The bigger the service the harder it is to defend it.

Termonillogy : 

		HOSTS
		FINGERPRINT ( telnet as an example has a motd )
		MAC-ADDRESS ( knowing the vendor as an example - SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  ) 
		PORTS ( MOST SERVICES ARE UNCHANGED )
		
		
=======================================NMAP=================================================================


HPing3 -1 - structures tcp/ip to anlayise the network for further information. It enables the sending of several ICMP requests
that will aid us in knowing the network, It also supports other protocols.

BASIC COMMANDS 

			HPing3 -1 *Target*
			Hping3 -1 10.0.0.x --ran-dest -i eth0 --fast ( Scans the whole network ).
			Hping3 --traceroute -v -1 8.8.8.8 --tr-stop
			
			

In normal scan, NMAP will show 1,000 of the most used ports. This is a TCP scan that uses three way hand-shake.

TCP FLAGS we should know.

		URG : tells us that it is urgent and needs to be porccessed instantly.
		PSH : Incase of a missing packet, This asks for a push in a specific order
		SYN : Syncing\
		ACK : Confirms the data has reached.
		RST : Reset the whole session.
		sS  : Allow us a silent request to avoid firewalls by avoiding AK!!! This is also faster ( Old and un-used )
		sU  : Scan UDP ports only. UDP unlike TCP does not send AK, However the OS can and does.
		O   : ( O not zero ) Identify the OS. As each OS responds with a different finger-print.
		Pn  : Incase a firewall exists then this will prevent nmap from sending the intial ping.
		
		ATTACHED FILE : NMAP_QUICK.MP4
		
		=========================SCANS======================
		
There are 3 types of scans that helps us by-pass AV or Firewalls ( IDS )
Most of the IDS block scanning attempts for security reasons - In that they continuously search for SYN messages in order to detect them.
These scans help us learn how the firewall works!

			fin scan - sF = If the machine is open, an RST should come back.
			null scan - sN = All of the flags are off! - If the port is open we wont get any response. If port is closed, an RST comes back.
			xmas scan - sX = URG + FIN + PUSH combined - If port is open, an RST comes back. If port is filtered - No response. If port closed, a FIN comes back.
			
Idle Scan.

	Topology 
		H = Attacker
		V = Victim
		Z = Zombie
		
		1. Syn to Zombie.
		2. Fin from zombie ( say Its a printer ) (get the IPID - ex : 600 )
		3. syn to victim from zombie 
		4. If the port is open target sends syn-ack to zombie
			   and zombie sends back RST ( IPID + 1 ) 601
			   If the port is closed the target doesnt send syn-ack to zombie
			   and zombie doesnt back RST ( IPID +0) 600.
		5. syn to zombie
		6. fin from zombie (get the IPID ) 600
		7.if IPID-2= old IPID the port is open
		  if IPID-1= old IPID the port is closed
			   
			   
			 Syntax to perform Idle scan = nmmap -sI <zombie> <target> -p 56
			 
So let's say we arrived at a new network of a random company. How the hell do we even get the zombie's IP???? Hah! 


nmap --script ipidseq 10.0.7.14 -p
If Incremental = Were good to go. If anything else, Keep searching.



NSE - Nmap Script Engine


There are actually scripts built that are specificly written for nmap. They are written in LUA.
We can use NSE with the following command ; --script "name of script"

NSE falls under few categories:

		auth ( often checks auth or even bypasses them )
		broadcast ( an example would be the ARP request )
		brute force ( we know that this is )
		default ( anything )
		discovery ( discover data )
		exploit ( an example would be DOS attack )
		malware ( can check if the target has been infected )
		external ( uses other websites to gain data ( an example would be http://whatismyip.com )
		vuln ( can check if the target is compromised ) 
		
We can also use all of these combined!  nmap 10.0.7.14 -p --script *


BYPASSING FIREWALLS FULLY

-t - time delay for the scan
-d - decoy - sending on the behalf of everyone
-f - fragmentation - the smaller the packet, the harder for the firewall to detect.
-a - Does everything to find everything and if it thinks theres a firewall he will use NSE.

Here's a situation, we scanned the target and got a bunch of ports that are opened, But who said port 80 is actually HTTP? We can use -sV to verify!.

Home work : 

Setup an SSH server but with different port. Test if you can verify if it is.
Get the banner manually! hint : netcat
Scan your home, Give a foot massage to your wife using nmap.|



Extra tools for scanning

zenmap, netdiscover 10.0.0.0/16 , p0f , masscan.
